  - Urgency detection (high/medium/low priority)
  - Product/service interest identification

- **Contextual Understanding:**
  - Multi-turn conversation context
  - Reference resolution ("my company", "the product I mentioned")
  - Implicit information extraction

**Implementation:**
- Use Groq with structured output (JSON mode)
- Fine-tune prompts for better extraction
- Add validation and confidence scoring
- Store extracted entities in structured format

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
