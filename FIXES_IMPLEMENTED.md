## 📋 Fixes Summary

### ✅ Fix 1: Test User Credentials Reset (Priority 1 - CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Test credentials didn't match test expectations. Tests expected `password123` but actual passwords were `TestFree123!`, `TestPro123!`, `TestPromax123!`.

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Created `reset-test-user-passwords.js` script
- ✅ Reset all 3 test user passwords to `password123`
- ✅ Verified each password works with authentication
- ✅ Updated `test-credentials.json` to reflect new passwords

**Result:**
```
✅ free@test.com: password reset to 'password123' and verified
✅ pro@test.com: password reset to 'password123' and verified  
✅ promax@test.com: password reset to 'password123' and verified
```

**Impact:** Unblocks 17 authentication-dependent tests.

### ✅ Fix 2: Password Reset Feature Added (Priority 2)

**Issue:** TC005 failed - Password reset option missing on login page.

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Added "Forgot password?" link to login page (`Login.tsx`)
- ✅ Created `ForgotPassword.tsx` page component
- ✅ Integrated with existing `authService.requestPasswordReset()` function
- ✅ Added route `/forgot-password` in `App.tsx`
- ✅ Connected to existing password reset flow at `/auth/reset-password`

**Files Modified:**
- `callwaitingai-landing/src/pages/Login.tsx` - Added forgot password link
- `callwaitingai-landing/src/pages/ForgotPassword.tsx` - New component
- `callwaitingai-landing/src/App.tsx` - Added route

**Result:** ✅ Password reset flow now accessible from login page.

### ✅ Fix 3: Health Check Database Connectivity (Priority 2)

**Issue:** TC016 failed - Health check showed database as "Not available" even when system is healthy.

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Updated `supabase/functions/health/index.ts`
- ✅ Changed database connectivity check to use simpler query
- ✅ Added fallback: tries `payments` table first, then `users` table
- ✅ Improved error reporting

**Changes:**
- Before: Query `users` table with `.select('count').single()` (problematic)
- After: Query `payments` or `users` table with `.select('id').limit(1)` (reliable)

**Result:** ✅ Health check now properly detects database connectivity.
