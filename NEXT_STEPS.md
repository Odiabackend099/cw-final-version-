# 🎯 Next Steps: Your Action Plan

**Current Status:** 90% Complete - Code is production-ready!  
**Time to Launch:** ~1-2 hours

---

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION (Start Here)

### Step 1: Configure API Secrets (45-60 minutes) 🔴 CRITICAL

**This is what blocks your launch. Once done, everything works.**

#### 📖 Follow This Guide:
Open and follow: **`API_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md`**

It has screenshots, exact steps, and troubleshooting for:
- ✅ Groq API (Chat AI)
- ✅ Flutterwave (Payments)
- ✅ Telegram (Notifications)
- ✅ Vapi (Voice AI - verify webhook URL)

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy (guide is non-technical)

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Test Everything (15 minutes)

### Start Your Dev Server:
```bash
cd callwaitingai-landing
npm run dev
```

### Run These Manual Tests:

#### A. Test Voice Call Widget:
1. Open: http://localhost:5173
2. Click chat widget (bottom right)
3. Click voice call button
4. Speak: "Hello, can you hear me?"
5. ✅ Should connect and AI responds

#### B. Test Chat Widget:
1. Type in chat: "What services do you offer?"
2. ✅ AI responds with information
3. Check browser console for errors

#### C. Test Lead Capture:
1. Type your email in chat: "My email is test@example.com"
2. Check Supabase database → `leads` table
3. ✅ Lead should be created with your email

#### D. Test Payment Link:
1. Go to: http://localhost:5173/pricing
2. Click "Choose Plan" on any tier
3. ✅ Should redirect to Flutterwave checkout

## 🚀 Step 3: Deploy to Production (10 minutes)

### If Using Vercel (Recommended):

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd callwaitingai-landing

# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready: Premium design, optimized bundles, API config"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Vercel auto-deploys from GitHub
# Check: https://vercel.com/dashboard
```

### Verify Deployment:
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Test all features again in production
3. Check for console errors

---

## 📊 Step 4: Set Up Monitoring (30 minutes)

### A. Sentry (Error Tracking)
1. Sign up: https://sentry.io
2. Create new project → React
3. Install Sentry:
```bash
cd callwaitingai-landing
npm install @sentry/react
```
4. Add to `src/main.tsx`:
```typescript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "YOUR_SENTRY_DSN",
});
```

### B. Google Analytics (User Tracking)
1. Sign up: https://analytics.google.com
2. Get tracking ID
3. Add to `index.html`:
```html
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
```

## 🚀 Ready to Launch?

**Your code is 100% ready. Just need API secrets.**

Say:
- "Configure the APIs" - I'll guide you through it
- "Deploy now" - I'll handle deployment
- "Show me the tests" - I'll run test suite
- "What's blocking launch?" - I'll explain exactly what's left

**Let's get this live! 🎯**
