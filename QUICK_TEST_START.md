# 🚀 Quick Start - TestSprite Testing

## ✅ Infrastructure Fixes Applied!

Both fixes have been implemented:
1. ✅ Vite config updated for tunnel access
2. ✅ Production build testing setup ready

---

## 🎯 Choose Your Testing Method

### Method 1: Production Build (Most Reliable) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

```bash
# Terminal 1: Build and serve production version
cd callwaitingai-landing
pnpm preview:test

# Terminal 2: Run TestSprite tests
cd /Users/odiadev/Desktop/active\ cwi\ november/cw-final-version-
node /Users/odiadev/.npm/_npx/8ddf6bea01b2519d/node_modules/@testsprite/testsprite-mcp/dist/index.js generateCodeAndExecute
```

**Why this is best:**
- ✅ Most reliable through tunnel
- ✅ No WebSocket HMR issues
- ✅ Faster resource loading
- ✅ Production-like environment

---

### Method 2: Dev Server with Test Mode

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server in test mode
cd callwaitingai-landing
pnpm dev:test

# Terminal 2: Run TestSprite tests
cd /Users/odiadev/Desktop/active\ cwi\ november/cw-final-version-
node /Users/odiadev/.npm/_npx/8ddf6bea01b2519d/node_modules/@testsprite/testsprite-mcp/dist/index.js generateCodeAndExecute
```

**Note:** May still have WebSocket warnings, but functionality should work.

---

## ✅ Verify Setup

Before running tests, verify:

1. **Server is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5173 | head -20
   # Should return HTML content
   ```

2. **Application loads in browser:**
   - Open: http://localhost:5173
   - Should see your application

3. **Test users are ready:**
   - ✅ free@test.com / TestFree123!
   - ✅ pro@test.com / TestPro123!
   - ✅ promax@test.com / TestPromax123!

---

## 📊 Expected Results

After fixes, you should see:
- ✅ Resources loading correctly
- ✅ Application rendering in tests
- ✅ Tests executing properly
- ✅ Expected pass rate: 60-80% (vs 0% before)

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Vite Server Configuration**
   - Added `host: '0.0.0.0'` for external access
   - Configured HMR for tunnel compatibility
   - Added CORS support

2. **Production Build Scripts**
   - `pnpm build:test` - Build optimized version
   - `pnpm preview:test` - Serve on 0.0.0.0:5173
   - Better reliability through tunnel

---

## 🆘 If Tests Still Fail

1. **Check server is accessible:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5173
   ```

2. **Try production build instead:**
   ```bash
   cd callwaitingai-landing
   pnpm preview:test
   ```

3. **Restart dev server:**
   - Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   - Run `pnpm dev:test` again

4. **Verify tunnel connection:**
   - Check TestSprite logs for tunnel status
   - Ensure proxy URL is correct in config

**Ready to test!** Choose Method 1 for best results. 🎯
