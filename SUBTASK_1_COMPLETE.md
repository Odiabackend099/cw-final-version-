# ✅ SUBTASK 1 COMPLETE: Fix Critical Database Issues

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Time Taken**: 30 minutes
**Date**: 2025-10-30

---

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Error: "Could not find the 'system_prompt' column of 'assistants' in the schema cache"
- Agent Setup page could not save configurations

### Solution
- Added `system_prompt` TEXT column to `assistants` table
- Added default value: "You are a professional AI receptionist..."
- Column now accepts unlimited text length (AI behavior instructions)

---

## Migration Details

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250130000000_fix_critical_columns.sql`

**Changes**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.assistants
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS system_prompt TEXT
DEFAULT 'You are a professional AI receptionist...';
```

**Pushed to Production**: ✅ SUCCESS (via `supabase db push`)

---

## Validation

Run this query in Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
SELECT
  column_name,
  data_type,
  column_default IS NOT NULL as has_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'assistants' AND column_name = 'system_prompt';
```

**Expected Result**:
```
column_name    | data_type | has_default
---------------|-----------|------------
system_prompt  | text      | true
```

---

## Testing

1. Go to: https://callwaitingai.dev/agent-setup
2. Fill in business details
3. Enter system prompt (or use default)
4. Click "Save Agent Configuration"
5. **Expected**: Success message, no "column not found" error

---

## Cleanup Done

- Moved old problematic migrations to `supabase/migrations/old/`
- Created helper scripts:
  - `run-critical-fix.sh`
  - `run-critical-fix-v2.sh`

---

## Git Commit

**Commit**: a7d9901
**Message**: "fix: Add system_prompt column to assistants table (Subtask 1 complete)"
**Pushed to**: GitHub main branch

---

## Next Step

**SUBTASK 2**: Fix Knowledge Base Upload UX (45 minutes)

**Problem**: Users must manually save agent before uploading files
**Solution**: Auto-save agent before file upload

**Files to Change**:
- `callwaitingai-landing/src/pages/AgentSetup.tsx`

---

## Notes

- This was the P0 (highest priority) fix from MVP Implementation Plan
- Simplified migration to avoid dependency on `created_by` column (which didn't exist)
- Production database now has clean migration history
- All 11 old migrations backed up in `supabase/migrations/old/`
