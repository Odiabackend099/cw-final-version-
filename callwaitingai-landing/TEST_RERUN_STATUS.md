## Fixes Applied (From TEST_FIXES_SUMMARY.md)

### ✅ Fix 1: Auth Session Error Handling
**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Changed from `getUser()` to `getSession()` to avoid throwing errors
- Added proper handling for missing auth sessions
- **Expected Impact:** 10 tests should now pass (TC002, TC006-TC009, TC011-TC015)

### ✅ Fix 2: Password Reset Route
**File:** `src/App.tsx`
- Added `/reset-password` route for test compatibility
- Now supports multiple reset URL formats
- **Expected Impact:** TC004 should now pass

### ✅ Fix 3: Password Reset Token Handling
**File:** `src/pages/PasswordReset.tsx`
- Added support for legacy `?token=` parameter format
- Validates both Supabase and test token formats
- **Expected Impact:** Improves TC004 reliability

### ✅ Fix 4: Test User Seed Script
**Files:** `scripts/seed-test-users.ts`, `scripts/README.md`
- Created professional test data seeding script
- Provides known test credentials for authenticated tests
- **Expected Impact:** TC011, TC012 should pass with seeded users

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Add TestSprite Credits**
   - Visit: https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/settings/billing
   - Add sufficient credits for test execution
   - Re-run the test suite

2. **Seed Test Users** (Recommended before re-run)
   ```bash
   cd callwaitingai-landing
   npm install -D tsx dotenv
   # Add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to .env
   npx tsx scripts/seed-test-users.ts
   ```

3. **Re-run TestSprite Tests**
   ```bash
   TESTSPRITE_API_KEY="your-key" \
   node /Users/odiadev/.npm/_npx/.../testsprite-mcp/dist/index.js \
   generateCodeAndExecute
   ```

### Verification Steps

After adding credits and re-running:

1. Check test report: `testsprite_tests/tmp/raw_report.md`
2. Compare pass rates with previous run
3. Verify auth errors are eliminated
4. Confirm password reset route works
5. Validate authenticated flows with seeded users
