### üìä Research Findings

**Premium SaaS Design Best Practices (2024-2025):**

3. **Generous White Space**: More breathing room = premium feel
4. **Micro-interactions**: Subtle animations that feel expensive
5. **Social Proof**: Customer testimonials, logos, case studies prominently displayed
6. **Video/Visual Storytelling**: Hero video or animated illustrations
7. **Trust Signals**: Certifications, security badges, guarantees
8. **Refined Shadows & Depth**: Layered design with subtle shadows
9. **Premium CTAs**: Larger, more prominent with better copy
10. **Elegant Transitions**: Smooth page scrolling, fade-ins, parallax effects
