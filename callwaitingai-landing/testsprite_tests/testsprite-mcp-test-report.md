## 3️⃣ Requirement Validation Summary

### Requirement Group 1: Authentication System
**Description:** User authentication with email verification, password reset, signup, and login

#### Test TC001: User Signup and Email Verification Flow
- **Test Code:** [TC001_User_Signup_and_Email_Verification_Flow.py](./TC001_User_Signup_and_Email_Verification_Flow.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Test Error:** Signup form submission failed with a 'Failed to fetch' error. No email verification link was sent or indicated. The test cannot proceed further to verify email activation.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on React dependencies, CSS, and ErrorBoundary components
  - Failed to fetch from Supabase Auth signup endpoint
  - Multiple Vite module loading failures
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/5bd1f959-175d-47d3-a3f5-b3381af4d975)
- **Analysis / Findings:** The development server encountered network errors loading React modules, preventing the signup page from rendering properly. The Supabase Auth signup endpoint failed with `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE`, indicating either a network connectivity issue, server instability, or Vite HMR system experiencing connection failures. This is a critical infrastructure issue that must be resolved before authentication testing can proceed. The signup flow depends on both the frontend rendering correctly and the backend Supabase Auth service being accessible.

---

#### Test TC002: Login with Correct Credentials
- **Test Code:** [TC002_Login_with_Correct_Credentials.py](./TC002_Login_with_Correct_Credentials.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Test Error:** Login attempt with valid credentials failed due to 'Invalid login credentials' error message. User could not log in successfully.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on ErrorBoundary and React DOM modules
  - HTTP 400 error from Supabase Auth token endpoint
  - WebGL warnings (non-critical)
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/710c03aa-8d75-4f7d-ad2f-d59367e310a8)
- **Analysis / Findings:** Login functionality is failing with HTTP 400 from Supabase Auth API. This indicates either invalid test credentials (user doesn't exist), user account not verified, or incorrect Supabase configuration. The test needs valid registered user credentials that have been email-verified. Additionally, the development server is experiencing module loading failures that may interfere with authentication flows. Recommendation: Create test users in Supabase Auth with known credentials and ensure email verification is either completed or bypassed for test accounts.

---

#### Test TC003: Login Failure with Incorrect Credentials
- **Test Code:** [TC003_Login_Failure_with_Incorrect_Credentials.py](./TC003_Login_Failure_with_Incorrect_Credentials.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH

- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/8463a76f-7f56-42d9-8ed5-7c9f2e6ecdb4)
- **Analysis / Findings:** The password reset page failed to render due to Vite server connection issues. Multiple dependency modules failed to load (lucide-react for icons, Navigation component), preventing the page from displaying any UI elements. This prevents testing of the password reset flow entirely. The feature exists in the codebase (`src/pages/PasswordReset.tsx`) but cannot be validated until server stability is resolved.

---

### Requirement Group 2: AI Agent Configuration
**Description:** Setup and configure AI voice agents with business details, system prompts, voice selection, and knowledge base upload

#### Test TC005: AI Agent Configuration with Valid Inputs
- **Test Code:** [TC005_AI_Agent_Configuration_with_Valid_Inputs.py](./TC005_AI_Agent_Configuration_with_Valid_Inputs.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Test Error:** Testing stopped due to website loading failure. The login page and AI Agent Configuration page could not be accessed because the site showed a browser error page.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on ErrorBoundary component
  - HTTP 401 error from Vercel deployment URL
  - WebGL warnings
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/fff91354-be84-4297-a5d7-02ace23285bf)
- **Analysis / Findings:** The agent setup page could not be accessed due to initial page load failures. Additionally, the test attempted to access a Vercel deployment URL which returned HTTP 401, indicating authentication/authorization issues. The correct route for agent configuration should be `/agent-setup` (as defined in `App.tsx`), but the page could not load to validate business name input, system prompt configuration, voice selection, or knowledge base uploads.

---

#### Test TC006: AI Agent Configuration Input Validation
- **Test Code:** [TC006_AI_Agent_Configuration_Input_Validation.py](./TC006_AI_Agent_Configuration_Input_Validation.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Test Error:** The AI Agent Configuration page is not rendering properly and is empty, so validation tests cannot be performed.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `No routes matched location "/configuration"` (repeated 8 times)
  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on React DOM and FloatingChatWidget
  - Multiple WebGL warnings
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/ba30e0c9-fa08-4ce5-b044-cbf18e3050dc)
- **Analysis / Findings:** The test attempted to access `/configuration` which does not exist in the application router. Based on the codebase, the correct route should be `/agent-setup`. This indicates a mismatch between the test plan and actual application routes. Even if the correct route was used, the page failed to load due to server errors. The validation logic (empty business names, long system prompts, file upload limits) exists in the AgentSetup component but cannot be tested until routing is corrected and server stability is resolved.

---

#### Test TC007: File Upload Auto-save and Validation
- **Test Code:** [TC007_File_Upload_Auto_save_and_Validation.py](./TC007_File_Upload_Auto_save_and_Validation.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Test Error:** Multiple attempts to access the AI Agent Configuration upload section failed. Login attempts failed due to expired verification codes, preventing access to the upload functionality.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on multiple core modules
  - `No routes matched location "/ai-agent-configuration"`
  - Google Fonts loading failed
  - Google OAuth errors (400, 403)
  - Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy violations
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/f30deee2-95cf-4045-a36e-4d3d383cb012)
- **Analysis / Findings:** The test attempted to access `/ai-agent-configuration` which is not a valid route (should be `/agent-setup`). Additionally, authentication attempts failed due to expired verification codes and Google OAuth security restrictions. The knowledge base upload feature exists in the agent setup page but requires authenticated access. For automated testing, email/password authentication with pre-configured test accounts would be more reliable than OAuth flows.

---

### Requirement Group 3: Voice Call System
**Description:** Tier-based voice call testing with Vapi default voice for free tier and Minimax TTS for paid tiers

#### Test TC008: Voice Call Testing for Free Tier Using Vapi.ai
- **Test Code:** [TC008_Voice_Call_Testing_for_Free_Tier_Using_Vapi.ai.py](./TC008_Voice_Call_Testing_for_Free_Tier_Using_Vapi.ai.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Test Error:** The website at http://localhost:5173/ is completely empty with no interactive elements visible. Therefore, it was not possible to log in as a free tier user, initiate a voice call test, or verify the use of Vapi.ai TTS for the free subscription tier.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on ErrorBoundary component
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/09c22a80-ea7b-46d9-8699-709aac515ab5)
- **Analysis / Findings:** Unable to validate tier-based voice configuration (FREE tier → Vapi default) due to complete page load failure. The voice call tester component (`VoiceCallTester.tsx`) and Vapi integration (`vapi.ts`) exist in the codebase but cannot be tested. This is a critical feature that distinguishes free and paid tiers, and requires valid test accounts and a stable development environment.

---

#### Test TC009: Voice Call Testing for Paid Tiers Using Minimax TTS
- **Test Code:** [TC009_Voice_Call_Testing_for_Paid_Tiers_Using_Minimax_TTS.py](./TC009_Voice_Call_Testing_for_Paid_Tiers_Using_Minimax_TTS.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Test Error:** Unable to complete login as Professional or Pro tier user due to rate limiting on email verification and security restrictions on Google login. Therefore, cannot verify Minimax TTS usage or advanced voice features.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on Privacy page
  - HTTP 401, 400, 403 errors from various services
  - Google OAuth and Vercel SSO errors
  - Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy violations
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/56d64904-7acc-4e00-87cd-79defc4d6f42)
- **Analysis / Findings:** Unable to validate Minimax TTS usage for paid tiers due to authentication failures. The test attempted to use OAuth authentication which introduces additional complexity and security restrictions. For automated testing, email/password authentication with pre-configured paid-tier test accounts would be more reliable. The tier detection logic in `src/lib/userTier.ts` and voice configuration in `advancedVapi.ts` could not be validated without authenticated access.

---

### Requirement Group 4: API Integration & Webhooks
**Description:** Webhook integration, call logging, rate limiting, and health checks

#### Test TC010: Call Event Logging via Vapi Webhook
- **Test Code:** [TC010_Call_Event_Logging_via_Vapi_Webhook.py](./TC010_Call_Event_Logging_via_Vapi_Webhook.py)

- **Analysis / Findings:** Vapi webhook integration is functioning correctly. Voice call completion events successfully trigger webhooks that log call data accurately in the Supabase database. This validates that the Supabase Edge Function `/functions/v1/vapi-webhook` is properly deployed and processing incoming webhook payloads. Call data is persisted and accessible through the database, ensuring reliable call logging functionality.

---

#### Test TC011: Rate Limiting Enforcement on API Endpoints
- **Test Code:** [TC011_Rate_Limiting_Enforcement_on_API_Endpoints.py](./TC011_Rate_Limiting_Enforcement_on_API_Endpoints.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Test Error:** Login attempts with provided credentials failed due to invalid login credentials error. Cannot proceed with testing call limits without successful login.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on core modules
  - HTTP 400 error from Supabase Auth token endpoint
  - `TypeError: Failed to fetch`
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/ff2bd508-603d-454a-b6a9-6f20bc17dc9d)
- **Analysis / Findings:** Unable to validate API rate limiting (100 calls per hour per assistant) due to authentication failure. The rate limiting logic should return HTTP 429 when limits are exceeded, but this cannot be tested without valid authenticated access. The test needs valid free tier user credentials to proceed with rate limit validation.

---

#### Test TC012: Health Check Endpoint Returns 200 When Healthy
- **Test Code:** [TC012_Health_Check_Endpoint_Returns_200_When_Healthy.py](./TC012_Health_Check_Endpoint_Returns_200_When_Healthy.py)
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/e417b9c4-c4bb-4733-93e0-8f5c31d2aab1)
- **Analysis / Findings:** Health check endpoint is functioning correctly. The Supabase Edge Function `/functions/v1/health` returns HTTP 200 when the database connection is healthy, confirming that the backend service monitoring is operational. This endpoint is critical for uptime monitoring and system health validation.

---

#### Test TC013: Health Check Endpoint Returns 503 When Database Unreachable
- **Test Code:** [TC013_Health_Check_Endpoint_Returns_503_When_Database_Unreachable.py](./TC013_Health_Check_Endpoint_Returns_503_When_Database_Unreachable.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Test Error:** The health check endpoint was called after simulating database downtime, but no visible HTTP 503 status or error message indicating service unavailability was found on the page.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `No routes matched location "/health"` (frontend route doesn't exist)
  - `No routes matched location "/simulate-db-down"` (test simulation route doesn't exist)
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/97970ecb-5aab-401e-a1fb-f4bd7aa52d03)
- **Analysis / Findings:** The test attempted to access `/health` and `/simulate-db-down` as frontend routes, but these are backend API endpoints. Health check endpoints are typically Supabase Edge Functions (e.g., `https://bcufohulqrceytkrqpgd.supabase.co/functions/v1/health`) rather than frontend routes. The test should target the backend API directly rather than the React Router. To test database unavailability scenarios, the backend health check function would need to simulate or detect database connection failures.

---

### Requirement Group 5: Dashboard & Analytics
**Description:** Dashboard displaying call history, analytics, and performance metrics

#### Test TC014: Dashboard Displays Call History and Analytics Accurately
- **Test Code:** [TC014_Dashboard_Displays_Call_History_and_Analytics_Accurately.py](./TC014_Dashboard_Displays_Call_History_and_Analytics_Accurately.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Test Error:** Login attempts are blocked due to rate limiting with the message 'Too many attempts. Please try again later.'. Unable to proceed with login and access the Calls dashboard.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on core modules
  - HTTP 401 error from Vercel deployment
  - Google OAuth errors
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/1be1118b-5dcb-4103-8787-7d37646dfc52)
- **Analysis / Findings:** Dashboard functionality could not be tested due to authentication rate limiting. Multiple login attempts during the test suite execution triggered rate limiting protection. The dashboard page (`Dashboard.tsx`) and calls page (`Calls.tsx`) exist in the codebase but require authenticated access. Rate limiting is a security feature but prevents automated testing when credentials are invalid or accounts don't exist. Recommendation: Use valid test accounts or implement test mode that bypasses rate limiting for automated testing.

---

### Requirement Group 6: Lead Management
**Description:** Track and manage leads generated from calls and chats

#### Test TC015: Lead Management Captures Leads from Calls and Chat
- **Test Code:** [TC015_Lead_Management_Captures_Leads_from_Calls_and_Chat.py](./TC015_Lead_Management_Captures_Leads_from_Calls_and_Chat.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Test Error:** Task stopped due to inability to log in to the leads dashboard. Multiple login attempts failed with 'Invalid login credentials' error. Unable to verify if leads from simulated voice call and chat interactions appear in the leads dashboard.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on multiple modules
  - Vapi client not initialized error
  - HTTP 401 error from Groq chat API
  - Chat error: API error 401
  - HTTP 400 error from Supabase Auth

- **Analysis / Findings:** Lead management functionality could not be validated due to authentication failures. Additionally, the chat widget encountered authentication errors (401 from Groq chat API), indicating that the chat service requires authenticated sessions. The leads page (`Leads.tsx`) exists but requires authentication to access. The lead capture logic should be tested once valid test accounts are available and authentication issues are resolved.

---

### Requirement Group 7: User Management & Subscriptions
**Description:** Subscription tier detection, feature access control, settings, and payments

#### Test TC016: Subscription Tier Detection Enables/Disables Features Correctly
- **Test Code:** [TC016_Subscription_Tier_Detection_EnablesDisables_Features_Correctly.py](./TC016_Subscription_Tier_Detection_EnablesDisables_Features_Correctly.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Test Error:** Testing stopped due to critical backend database error preventing user account creation. Cannot verify subscription tier detection or feature enablement without valid user accounts.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on multiple components
  - `No routes matched location "/signin"` (should be `/login`)
  - `No routes matched location "/account"` (should be `/settings` or `/dashboard`)
  - HTTP 400 error from Supabase Auth
  - HTTP 500 error from Supabase Auth signup endpoint
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/fbd14553-0ccd-4131-bfb2-a5456a4ecf70)
- **Analysis / Findings:** Tier detection functionality could not be tested due to account creation failure. The test attempted to access incorrect routes (`/signin` instead of `/login`, `/account` instead of `/settings`). Additionally, Supabase Auth returned HTTP 500 error during signup, indicating a backend database issue. The tier detection logic in `src/lib/userTier.ts` correctly maps payment amounts to tiers (free, pro, professional, promax) but cannot be validated without successfully created user accounts with payment records.

---

#### Test TC017: Payment Subscription Management and History Display
- **Test Code:** [TC017_Payment_Subscription_Management_and_History_Display.py](./TC017_Payment_Subscription_Management_and_History_Display.py)

  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on core modules
  - HTTP 401, 400, 403 errors from various services
  - Google OAuth and Vercel SSO errors
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/865ebe06-27a2-4467-9336-e3dc72af3409)
- **Analysis / Findings:** Payment management functionality could not be tested due to authentication rate limiting. The payments page (`Payments.tsx`) exists in the codebase and integrates with Flutterwave for payment processing, but requires authenticated access. The payment history and subscription management features cannot be validated until authentication issues are resolved and valid test accounts with payment records are available.

---

### Requirement Group 8: UI/UX & Error Handling
**Description:** Mobile responsiveness, error boundaries, route protection, and accessibility

#### Test TC018: Mobile Responsiveness and Navigation Accessibility
- **Test Code:** [TC018_Mobile_Responsiveness_and_Navigation_Accessibility.py](./TC018_Mobile_Responsiveness_and_Navigation_Accessibility.py)
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/f4798d02-16ae-4dd4-bedd-ca087e4d1bd6)
- **Analysis / Findings:** Mobile responsiveness and navigation accessibility are functioning correctly. The application uses TailwindCSS responsive utilities and the `use-mobile` hook for device detection. Navigation components, mobile menu, and responsive layouts are properly implemented. The test verified that UI elements adapt correctly to different screen sizes and navigation remains accessible across devices.

---

#### Test TC019: Protected Routes Enforce Authentication
- **Test Code:** [TC019_Protected_Routes_Enforce_Authentication.py](./TC019_Protected_Routes_Enforce_Authentication.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Test Error:** Test did not provide specific error details.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - WebGL warnings (non-critical)
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/5848b1c6-ae1e-48e7-a5a0-4e33ed2f4f16)
- **Analysis / Findings:** Protected route enforcement could not be fully validated. The `ProtectedRoute` component exists in `App.tsx` and should redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`. However, the test results indicate the test may not have been able to properly verify redirect behavior. Route protection is critical for security - authenticated routes like `/dashboard`, `/calls`, `/leads`, `/payments`, `/settings`, and `/agent-setup` should not be accessible without valid authentication.

---

#### Test TC020: Global Error Boundary Catches and Displays Errors
- **Test Code:** [TC020_Global_Error_Boundary_Catches_and_Displays_Errors.py](./TC020_Global_Error_Boundary_Catches_and_Displays_Errors.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Test Error:** The application UI does not provide any interactive elements or components to manually trigger a runtime error for testing the global ErrorBoundary. The /error-trigger page is empty, and no error simulation controls are available.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on core modules
  - `No routes matched location "/error-trigger"` (test route doesn't exist)
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/6726ae0e-295d-451a-bd83-5ce73db1c1d7)
- **Analysis / Findings:** The ErrorBoundary component exists in the codebase (`ErrorBoundary.tsx`) and wraps the application in `main.tsx`, but there is no test route or mechanism to trigger runtime errors for validation. The test attempted to access `/error-trigger` which doesn't exist. To properly test error boundaries, the application could include a development-only test page or error simulation button, or the test could inject JavaScript to trigger errors programmatically. Error boundaries are important for graceful error handling and user experience.

---

- **Test Code:** [TC021_End_to_End_User_Flow_from_Signup_to_Call_Logging.py](./TC021_End_to_End_User_Flow_from_Signup_to_Call_Logging.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Test Error:** Test did not provide specific error details.
- **Browser Errors:**
  - WebGL warnings (non-critical)
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/6f872a45-46bf-41ec-9e66-665f8d240596)
- **Analysis / Findings:** The complete user journey could not be validated. This test is critical for ensuring the entire platform workflow functions cohesively from user registration through to active call logging. The end-to-end flow should cover: signup → email verification → login → agent setup → voice call testing → call logging. Without successful execution, we cannot confirm the integrated workflow functions correctly.

---

### Requirement Group 10: Performance & Load Testing
**Description:** System stability under concurrent user load

#### Test TC022: System Supports 100 Simultaneous Free Tier Users
- **Test Code:** [TC022_System_Supports_100_Simultaneous_Free_Tier_Users.py](./TC022_System_Supports_100_Simultaneous_Free_Tier_Users.py)

#### Test TC023: Uptime Monitoring Shows 99%+ Uptime Post-Launch
- **Test Code:** [TC023_Uptime_Monitoring_Shows_99_Uptime_Post_Launch.py](./TC023_Uptime_Monitoring_Shows_99_Uptime_Post_Launch.py)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Test Error:** Failed to go to the start URL. Err: Error executing action go_to_url: Page.goto: Timeout 60000ms exceeded.
- **Call log:**
  - navigating to "http://localhost:5173/", waiting until "load"
- **Test Visualization:** [View Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/33b1d10e-3b2a-4583-998b-23dbb41332e4/395cd3d1-e171-45cb-ad7b-873f25debc29)
- **Analysis / Findings:** Uptime monitoring cannot be tested through the frontend application. This test timed out attempting to load the homepage, indicating server instability during test execution. Uptime monitoring typically requires access to monitoring service dashboards (e.g., Vercel Analytics, Uptime Robot, or custom monitoring solutions) to verify 99%+ uptime metrics and alerting configuration. This is an infrastructure/DevOps concern rather than a frontend feature test.

## 5️⃣ Key Gaps / Risks

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **Vite Development Server Instability** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - **Impact:** 82.61% test failure rate, with most failures due to `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` errors preventing page rendering
   - **Root Cause:** Vite dependency optimization or HMR (Hot Module Replacement) system experiencing connection failures, causing React modules, CSS, and components to fail loading
   - **Affected Tests:** TC001, TC003, TC004, TC005, TC006, TC007, TC008, TC011, TC014, TC015, TC016, TC017, TC020, TC023
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Restart the development server with cleared cache: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite && pnpm dev`
     - Test on production build instead: `pnpm build && pnpm preview` for more stability
     - Check for port conflicts on 5173
     - Verify network stability and firewall settings
     - Consider increasing Vite server timeout in `vite.config.ts`
     - Investigate WebSocket connection stability for HMR

2. **Missing Test User Credentials** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - **Impact:** Cannot test authentication flows, tier-based features, or protected routes end-to-end
   - **Root Cause:** No valid test users configured in Supabase Auth with known credentials
   - **Affected Tests:** TC002, TC003, TC005, TC007, TC008, TC009, TC011, TC014, TC015, TC016, TC017, TC021
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Create test users for each tier: free@test.com, pro@test.com, professional@test.com, promax@test.com
     - Ensure email verification is completed or bypassed for test accounts
     - Document test credentials in `.env.test` or secure test documentation
     - Set up Supabase test environment separate from production if possible
     - Implement test mode that bypasses email verification for automated testing

3. **Route Mismatches Between Tests and Application** ⚠️ HIGH
   - **Impact:** Tests targeting non-existent routes, causing failures and incorrect test coverage
   - **Root Cause:** Mismatch between test plan expectations and actual application routes in `App.tsx`
   - **Affected Tests:** TC006, TC007, TC013, TC016, TC020
   - **Issues Found:**
     - `/configuration` → Should be `/agent-setup`
     - `/ai-agent-configuration` → Should be `/agent-setup`
     - `/signin` → Should be `/login`
     - `/account` → Should be `/settings` or `/dashboard`
     - `/health` → Backend API endpoint, not frontend route
     - `/error-trigger` → Does not exist (test-only route needed)
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Update test plan with correct routes from `App.tsx`
     - Document application route structure for test planning
     - Create test-only routes for error simulation if needed
     - Separate backend API tests from frontend route tests

4. **Supabase Authentication Failures** ⚠️ HIGH
   - **Impact:** HTTP 400/500 errors from Supabase Auth endpoint preventing login and signup
   - **Root Cause:** Invalid credentials, users not existing in database, misconfigured Supabase project, or backend database errors
   - **Affected Tests:** TC001, TC002, TC011, TC014, TC015, TC016
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Verify Supabase project configuration:
       - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correct
       - Project is not paused or deleted
       - RLS (Row Level Security) policies allow test user access
     - Check Supabase Auth logs for detailed error messages
     - Ensure email confirmation is disabled for test environment
     - Investigate HTTP 500 error during signup (database connection issue)

5. **Authentication Rate Limiting Blocking Tests** ⚠️ HIGH
   - **Impact:** Multiple test failures due to 'Too many attempts' rate limiting after invalid login attempts
   - **Root Cause:** Security feature correctly preventing brute force attacks, but blocking automated testing with invalid credentials
   - **Affected Tests:** TC014, TC017
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Use valid test accounts instead of invalid credentials for testing
     - Implement test mode that bypasses or increases rate limiting thresholds
     - Add delay between test runs to avoid hitting rate limits
     - Use different test accounts for different test scenarios

---

### Medium Priority Issues

6. **OAuth Testing Complexity**
   - **Impact:** Google OAuth introduces security restrictions in automated testing (CORS, COOP policies)
   - **Affected Tests:** TC007, TC009, TC014, TC017
   - **Recommendation:** Use email/password authentication for E2E tests, reserve OAuth for manual testing or use OAuth testing tools

7. **Backend Health Check Testing**
   - **Impact:** Test attempted to access `/health` as frontend route when it's a backend API endpoint
   - **Affected Tests:** TC013
   - **Recommendation:** 
     - Update test to target Supabase Edge Function endpoint: `https://bcufohulqrceytkrqpgd.supabase.co/functions/v1/health`
     - Separate backend API tests from frontend tests
     - Add database simulation capabilities for testing 503 responses

8. **Missing Error Boundary Test Mechanism**
   - **Impact:** Cannot validate ErrorBoundary component catches and displays errors gracefully
   - **Affected Tests:** TC020
   - **Recommendation:** 
     - Add development-only test route `/error-trigger` with error simulation button
     - Or inject JavaScript in tests to trigger React errors programmatically
     - Ensure ErrorBoundary provides informative error messages to users

9. **Protected Route Testing Incomplete**
   - **Impact:** Route protection logic exists but could not be fully validated
   - **Affected Tests:** TC019
   - **Recommendation:** 
     - Verify redirect behavior when accessing protected routes without authentication
     - Test that authenticated users can access protected routes
     - Validate that unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`

---

### Low Priority Issues

10. **React Router Future Flags**
    - **Impact:** Console warnings but no functional impact
    - **Recommendation:** Opt into v7 features in `App.tsx`:
      ```typescript
      <BrowserRouter future={{ v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true }}>
      ```

11. **Google Fonts Loading Failures**
    - **Impact:** Fonts may not render correctly during tests (non-critical)
    - **Recommendation:** Self-host fonts or add retry logic for external resources

12. **WebGL Warnings**
    - **Impact:** Console warnings about software WebGL fallback (non-critical, browser-related)
    - **Recommendation:** These are browser environment warnings and don't affect functionality

## 6️⃣ Recommendations for Next Test Cycle

### Immediate Actions (Before Retesting)

1. ✅ **Restart Vite dev server with cleared cache:** `rm -rf node_modules/.vite && pnpm dev`
2. ✅ **Create and verify test user accounts in all tiers** (free, pro, professional, promax)
3. ✅ **Update test plan routes to match actual application routes** from `App.tsx`
4. ✅ **Test on production build** (`pnpm build && pnpm preview`) for stability instead of dev server
5. ✅ **Verify Supabase configuration** and environment variables
6. ✅ **Fix route mismatches** in test plan (update incorrect route expectations)

### Testing Strategy Improvements

1. **Split Frontend and Backend Tests:**
   - Frontend: UI, forms, routing, authentication flows, component rendering
   - Backend: API endpoints, webhooks, rate limiting, database operations, health checks
   - Clear separation prevents confusion between React Router routes and API endpoints

2. **Use Production/Staging Environment:** 
   - Test against deployed Vercel URL instead of localhost for stability
   - Or use production build locally: `pnpm build && pnpm preview`

3. **Implement Test User Management:**
   - Pre-populate database with test users in all tiers
   - Use email/password authentication (avoid OAuth for automated tests)
   - Document test credentials securely
   - Ensure email verification is bypassed or completed for test accounts

4. **Add Retry Logic:** 
   - Implement retry mechanisms for flaky network requests
   - Add delays between test runs to avoid rate limiting
   - Handle `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` with retries and exponential backoff

5. **Create Test Data Fixtures:** 
   - Pre-populate database with test users, agents, and calls
   - Use test-specific data that doesn't interfere with production
   - Implement database seeding scripts for test environment

### Feature-Specific Recommendations

1. **Tier-Based Voice Testing:** 
   - Requires valid paid tier account with Minimax configured
   - Create test accounts with payment records in database
   - Verify tier detection logic in `userTier.ts` with test data

2. **Knowledge Base Upload:** 
   - Needs authenticated session and valid agent setup
   - Test file upload with various file types and sizes
   - Validate auto-save functionality

3. **Leads Dashboard:** 
   - Requires pre-existing call/chat data to validate display
   - Seed database with sample leads from different sources
   - Verify lead filtering, sorting, and status updates

4. **Performance Testing:** 
   - Should be conducted on production or staging environment
   - Monitor resource usage during concurrent user load
   - Validate rate limiting thresholds

5. **Error Boundary Testing:**
   - Add test route or mechanism to trigger runtime errors
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly
   - Ensure error boundaries don't break application navigation
