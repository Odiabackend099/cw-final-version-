- **Test Error:** The signup process cannot be completed due to a backend database error preventing user registration. This blocks the ability to test email verification and account activation. Please resolve the backend issue to proceed with testing.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/aaabc7ff-a0d1-4388-a8c8-446401e0b9cb/a3cd0701-3eef-4bab-9503-30c200fe13ef
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Analysis / Findings:** Supabase Auth API returning 500 Internal Server Error on signup requests. Error: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 () at https://bcufohulqrceytkrqpgd.supabase.co/auth/v1/signup`. This indicates a backend/database configuration issue in Supabase, not a frontend problem. **Recommendation:** Check Supabase Auth settings, database constraints, and RLS policies for the `auth.users` table. Verify Supabase project health in dashboard.

#### Test TC002
- **Test Name:** Signup with Existing Email
- **Test Code:** [TC002_Signup_with_Existing_Email.py](./TC002_Signup_with_Existing_Email.py)

- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Analysis / Findings:** Tests are using hardcoded test credentials that don't exist in the database. Error: `AuthApiError: Invalid login credentials` from Supabase. **Root Cause:** TestSprite is attempting to use test credentials that haven't been created or verified. **Recommendation:** Create test user accounts in Supabase before running tests, or configure TestSprite to use existing valid credentials. The login flow itself is working correctly - the issue is authentication credentials.

#### Test TC004

   - **Issue:** TestSprite using hardcoded credentials that don't exist in database
   - **Impact:** Prevents login testing, blocking 10+ tests
   - **Affected Tests:** TC003, TC009, TC011, TC012, TC017, TC019, TC020
   - **Root Cause:** Test credentials not created or verified in Supabase
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Create test user accounts in Supabase before running tests
     - Configure TestSprite with valid credentials in test configuration
     - Or create test users via Supabase Dashboard/API
   - **Priority:** **HIGH** - This blocks authentication-dependent tests

#### 3. **Route Mismatches (MEDIUM - TEST CONFIGURATION)**
   - **Issue:** Tests navigating to incorrect routes
   - **Impact:** Tests fail due to wrong paths, not code issues
   - **Affected Tests:** TC007 (`/configuration` → should be `/dashboard/agent-setup`), TC009 (`/knowledge-base-upload` → part of agent-setup)
   - **Root Cause:** Test navigation paths don't match actual application routes
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Update test navigation to use correct routes
     - TC007: Navigate to `/dashboard/agent-setup` instead of `/configuration`
     - TC009: Navigate to `/dashboard/agent-setup` for knowledge base upload
   - **Priority:** **MEDIUM** - Test configuration issue, not code bug

#### 4. **Password Reset UI Discovery (MEDIUM - UX)**
   - **Issue:** Password reset route exists but no link on login page
   - **Impact:** Users cannot discover password reset functionality
   - **Affected Tests:** TC005
   - **Root Cause:** Route alias exists (`/password-reset` → `/auth/reset-password`) but no UI link
   - **Recommendation:** Add "Forgot Password?" link on login page
   - **Priority:** **MEDIUM** - Improves UX, not blocking

#### 5. **Microphone Device Access (LOW - TEST ENVIRONMENT)**
   - **Issue:** Automated tests cannot access microphone for voice calls
   - **Impact:** Voice call tests fail due to device permissions
   - **Affected Tests:** TC014, TC017
   - **Root Cause:** Browser security restrictions in automated test environment
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Manual testing for voice call functionality
     - Or configure test browser with microphone permissions
     - Rate limiting should be tested at Edge Function level
   - **Priority:** **LOW** - Test environment limitation, not code issue

## 6️⃣ Recommendations & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required (Priority Order)

#### Priority 1: Fix Supabase Auth Backend (CRITICAL)
1. **Check Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bcufohulqrceytkrqpgd
   - Check: Settings → Auth → Configuration
   - Verify: Email confirmation settings
   - Review: Auth logs for error details

2. **Check Database Constraints**
   - Verify: `auth.users` table constraints
   - Check: RLS policies for auth operations
   - Review: Database logs for 500 errors

3. **Verify Project Health**
   - Check: Project quota and limits
   - Verify: Database connection status
   - Review: Recent Supabase service status

4. **Test Manually**
   - Attempt signup via UI
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Review Supabase Auth logs

#### Priority 2: Create Test User Accounts (HIGH)
1. **Create Test Users in Supabase**
   - Free tier user
   - Professional tier user
   - Pro tier user (for Minimax TTS testing)

2. **Configure TestSprite**
   - Update test credentials in configuration
   - Or create users before test execution

#### Priority 3: Fix Test Route Mismatches (MEDIUM)
1. **Update Test Navigation**
   - TC007: Change `/configuration` → `/dashboard/agent-setup`
   - TC009: Change `/knowledge-base-upload` → `/dashboard/agent-setup`

2. **Add Password Reset Link**
   - Add "Forgot Password?" link on login page
   - Link to `/auth/reset-password` or `/password-reset`

### Expected Outcomes After Fixes

Once **Priority 1** (Supabase Auth) is fixed:
- **Expected Pass Rate:** 60-75% (15-18/24 tests)
- **Authentication:** 5/5 tests should pass
- **Agent Configuration:** 4-5/5 tests should pass
- **Voice Calls:** 2-3/4 tests should pass (excluding microphone-dependent tests)
- **End-to-End:** 1/1 test should pass

Once **Priority 2** (Test Credentials) is fixed:
- **Expected Pass Rate:** 70-85% (17-20/24 tests)
- **All authentication-dependent tests should pass**

Once **Priority 3** (Route Fixes) is fixed:
- **Expected Pass Rate:** 75-90% (18-22/24 tests)
- **All route-related tests should pass**

### Non-Blocking Issues (Low Priority)

1. **TC014 - Rate Limiting**
   - Requires Edge Function level testing
   - Not a frontend issue
   - Can be tested separately

2. **TC022 - Uptime Monitoring**
   - Requires manual setup
   - Expected to fail in automated tests
   - No code changes needed

3. **Microphone Access for Voice Tests**
   - Test environment limitation
   - Manual testing recommended
   - Code is correct, permissions are the issue
